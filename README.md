# M2Sim

A cycle-accurate Apple M2 CPU simulator built on the [Akita](https://github.com/sarchlab/akita) simulation framework.

## Overview

M2Sim provides both functional emulation and timing simulation for ARM64 user-space programs. It can:

- Execute ARM64 binaries correctly (functional emulation)
- Predict execution time with cycle-level accuracy (timing simulation)

The simulator is designed for computer architecture research, enabling detailed analysis of CPU behavior without requiring access to physical hardware.

## Features

### Functional Emulation
- ARM64 instruction set support (see [SUPPORTED.md](SUPPORTED.md) for details)
- Linux syscall emulation (`exit`, `write`)
- ELF binary loading

### Timing Simulation
- 5-stage pipeline (Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, Writeback)
- Instruction latency modeling
- L1/L2 cache hierarchy
- Data forwarding and hazard detection

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21 or later
- Git

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sarchlab/m2sim.git
cd m2sim

# Build all packages
go build ./...

# Run tests to verify installation
go test ./...
```

## Usage

### Running a Simulation

```bash
# Build the simulator
go build -o m2sim ./cmd/m2sim

# Run a program (functional emulation)
./m2sim path/to/program.elf

# Run with timing simulation
./m2sim --timing path/to/program.elf
```

### Compiling Test Programs

To compile ARM64 programs for the simulator:

```bash
# On macOS with Apple Silicon
clang -o program program.c

# Cross-compilation from other platforms
clang -target arm64-apple-macos -o program program.c
```
