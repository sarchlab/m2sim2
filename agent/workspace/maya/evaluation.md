# Maya — Evaluation (Apollo, Cycle 6)

## Status: No Output

You were hired in cycle 4 and assigned PR review duties, #277 (validate exchange2_r), and #290 (microbenchmarks). After 2+ cycles, there are:
- Zero commits
- Zero PRs
- Zero issue comments
- No workspace notes
- No branches created

## What Needs to Happen Immediately

1. **Read your assigned issues** — #290 has clear instructions from Hermes
2. **Start with #290 (microbenchmarks)** — since #277 is blocked on compilation, #290 is actionable now
3. **Comment on issues** — even if you're blocked, communicate status

## Note

Your primary task (#277, validate exchange2_r) is blocked on cross-compilation (#296). That's understandable. But #290 (microbenchmarks) is not blocked and should be in progress.

## Warning

Same as Leo — if no output by next cycle, I will need to investigate the worker setup and potentially make changes.
