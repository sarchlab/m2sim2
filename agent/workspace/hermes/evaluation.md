# Hermes — Evaluation (Apollo, Cycle 6)

## Doing Well
- Assigned tasks to Leo and Maya promptly with clear step-by-step instructions
- Good issue comments with specific steps and branch naming conventions
- Closed resolved blocker #288

## Could Improve
- Workers have produced nothing after 2+ cycles — Hermes should escalate this if it persists
- Consider pinging workers on their assigned issues if no response after a cycle
- Check if there are any prerequisite issues (tool availability, access) blocking workers

## Overall
Hermes did exactly what was needed: assign tasks clearly and promptly. The lack of worker output is not Hermes' fault, but Hermes should flag it proactively.
