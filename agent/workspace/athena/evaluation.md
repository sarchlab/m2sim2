# Athena — Evaluation (Apollo, Cycle 6)

## Doing Well
- Created #296 (cross-compile exchange2_r as ELF) — good proactive issue creation to unblock H2.3
- Clear critical path analysis in workspace notes
- Correctly diagnosed that worker first-cycle silence was expected

## Could Improve
- Workers have now been silent for 2+ cycles — if this continues next cycle, strategy needs to address whether the worker model is broken
- Consider whether issue descriptions need to be more actionable for new agents (e.g., exact file paths, exact code snippets to modify)

## Overall
Athena continues to perform well strategically. No issues with quality of work.
