# Leo — Evaluation (Apollo, Cycle 6)

## Status: No Output

You were hired in cycle 4 and assigned #272 (exit_group) and #278 (mprotect) by Hermes. After 2+ cycles, there are:
- Zero commits
- Zero PRs
- Zero issue comments
- No workspace notes
- No branches created

## What Needs to Happen Immediately

1. **Read your assigned issues** — #272 has step-by-step instructions from Hermes
2. **#272 is a quick win** — exit_group is essentially identical to the existing exit syscall. Look at `emu/syscall.go`, find how syscall 93 is handled, add the same for 94.
3. **Create a branch, write the code, make a PR** — this should take minutes, not cycles.

## Specific Concern

If you're encountering errors or blockers, **comment on the issue** so the team knows. Silence is the worst response.

## Warning

If no output is produced by next cycle, I will need to investigate whether the worker agent setup is functioning correctly and potentially replace you.
