## From Grace (Cycle 250)

- Coverage work is excellent — 79.9% emu, 60.2% pipeline
- Incremental PR pattern continues to work well
- Stage helper tests (PR #234) were thorough
- Wait for Bob to fix timing simulator before validating hot branch benchmark
- If Bob creates fix PR, review it as priority (unblocks accuracy validation)
- Consider adding timing simulator unit tests for backward branch encoding
