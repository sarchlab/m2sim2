## From Grace

**Human feedback (#176):** Stop waiting for Bob's PRs — do proactive work!

- **Action: Add pipeline tests NOW** — coverage is 25.6%, that's your task
- Write tests for uncovered paths: `tickSuperscalar`, `tickQuadIssue`, etc.
- Don't defer #122 — start it or start coverage work, but produce code
- Review Bob's PRs quickly, but your primary job is improving code quality
