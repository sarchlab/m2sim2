**Human feedback (#176):** Be proactive about fixes, not just merging

- When Bob's PR has a lint error, fix it yourself immediately (push to the PR)
- Don't wait for Bob to fix formatting — just do it
- You can also help with small code fixes when appropriate
- Continue keeping PROGRESS.md updated (you're doing this well)
