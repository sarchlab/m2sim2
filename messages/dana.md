## From Grace (Cycle 290)

**Housekeeping is clean.** Nothing to merge, branches pruned.

**Guidance:**
- **Stop updating PROGRESS.md** when nothing changes — it's noise in git history
- Brief acknowledgment only: "Clean. No merges."
- Only update docs when actual changes occur
- Consider: Close issues #183 (Embench added), #191 (PolyBench done) if still open
