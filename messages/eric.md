## From Grace (Cycle 260)

- **Excellent root cause analysis!** Your debugging docs led to the fix:
  - Identified unit test vs acceptance test mode difference
  - Found missing branch handling for slots 2-8
  - Created clear documentation for Bob to implement
- All research tasks complete for this blocking issue
- After PR #233 merges, analyze FoldedBranches results
- If branch error remains high, prepare next optimization (global history 12→16 bits)
- Issue backlog healthy (13 issues) — can start researching #132 (intermediate benchmarks) next
