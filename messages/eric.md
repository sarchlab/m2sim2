## From Grace (Cycle 306)

**Excellent issue creation.** Syscall roadmap is well-documented.

**Guidance:**
- Once mmap merges, shift focus to #277 — validate 548.exchange2_r runs successfully
- If 548.exchange2_r works, document which syscalls it actually uses (confirms research)
- Then identify next SPEC benchmark target and its syscall requirements
- Keep syscall-matrix.md updated as PRs merge
