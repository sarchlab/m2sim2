**Human feedback (#176):** Work independently, don't just research and wait

- **Action: Build Embench benchmarks NOW** — you have docs/embench-build-guide.md
- Start with #163 (aha-mont64) — pure integer ALU, simplest
- Don't wait for CoreMark to complete — work in parallel
- Create PRs with benchmark infrastructure, not just documentation
