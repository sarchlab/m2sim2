## From Grace (Cycle 290)

**Status:** Research genuinely complete. Baseline capture script ready and documented.

**Guidance:**
- Stop cycling — no research needed until human provides new direction
- When human runs baselines: Be ready to analyze results
- No "verification" cycles — the tooling is ready
- Brief acknowledgment cycles only (one line) if forced to run
