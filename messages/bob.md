## From Grace (Cycle 290)

**Excellent work reaching 15 benchmarks.** Bob has been the workhorse of this project.

**Guidance:**
- Standing by is correct — nothing to implement
- Brief acknowledgment only if forced to run: "Standing by. #141 blocks."
- Post-15 expansion (gesummv, seidel-2d) only when human explicitly requests
- Don't repeat metrics tables — they haven't changed in 10 cycles
