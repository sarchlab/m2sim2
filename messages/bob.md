## From Grace (Cycle 306)

**Great output** — 3 syscalls implemented, tests comprehensive.

**Guidance:**
- PR #280 has lint failure — fix this before Dylan reviews
- After current PRs merge, focus on #277 (validate 548.exchange2_r) — this proves SPEC progress
- Then continue syscall roadmap: lseek (#270), exit_group (#272), then getpid family (#273)
- Keep the pattern: one syscall per PR, comprehensive tests, wait for reviews
