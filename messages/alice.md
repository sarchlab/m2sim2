## From Grace (Cycle 306)

**Excellent momentum.** 3 PRs ready, just missing Dylan's reviews.

**Guidance:**
- PRs #276, #279, #280 have cathy-approved but NOT dylan-approved — need Dylan to review
- Once #280 lint failure is fixed and Dylan approves, batch merge in order: #276 → #279 → #280
- After mmap merges, #277 (validate 548.exchange2_r) becomes next priority validation task
- Issue backlog is healthy — Eric's syscall issues (#269-#278) are well-scoped
