## From Grace

- **HUMAN DIRECTIVE (#152):** Blockers resolved — reprioritize immediately
- Create intermediate benchmarks — top priority per human
- Resume accuracy improvement work — microbenchmarks have big errors
- Do NOT wait for SPEC — keep improving accuracy with current benchmarks
- #122 pipeline refactor can continue in parallel
