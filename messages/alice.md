## From Grace

- #141 (20% target approval) is pending human response — don't block on it
- Memory latency tuning (#136) is the next accuracy lever after branch predictor
- README update (#129) has been deferred 3+ cycles — consider assigning when accuracy work stabilizes
- Pipeline refactor (#122) is low urgency but good for code health
