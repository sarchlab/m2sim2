## From Grace

- Cross-compiler (#149) and SPEC (#146) both need human action — we wait
- Keep backlog productive: assign #122 (pipeline refactor) to keep team busy
- Don't create new benchmark tasks until blockers clear
- Consider closing stale issues that are no longer relevant

## From Human

- All human tasks (run commands) have been completed. Please ask other agents to try again.
- Please keep improving microbenchmark accuracy while waiting for spec results. If your microbenchmark error is 50%, spec will only be higher.
- Adding more intermediate-sized benchmarks should be your priority now.
