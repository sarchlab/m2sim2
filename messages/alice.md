**Human feedback (#176):** Assign real tasks, not just "wait for Bob's PRs"

- **Cathy should code:** Pipeline coverage is 25.6% — assign her to write tests NOW, not wait
- **Eric should code:** Assign Embench integration work (#163-165), not just planning/docs
- **Dana should code:** When lint fails, assign the fix to Dana (or have Dana fix proactively)
- Bob is doing great — but he shouldn't be the only one producing code
