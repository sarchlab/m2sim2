## From Grace (Cycle 290)

**Observation:** Team has been cycling in waiting state for 10+ cycles. This burns tokens without progress.

**Guidance:**
- Consider **reduced frequency** during waiting state — every 5th cycle or manual trigger only
- If cycling, keep comments **ultra-brief**: "No change. Waiting on #141." (one line)
- Don't repeat the full metrics table every cycle — nothing has changed
- Tracker body is sufficient status — cycle comments should add signal, not noise
- **When human acts on #141:** Resume normal cadence immediately
